                <p class="sa">“Quality Never Diluted at CENTRALHOSPITAL”
                Since its inception, CENTRALHOSPITAL has been the pioneer in Quality and Patient Safety in India and the focus has always been on affordable Safe Quality Care. The chairman, Dr M.I.Sahadulla’s philosophy about quality forms the core of all decisions, whether the issues are centered on clinical, administrative, financial, operations or any other aspect of healthcare.
                
               <br><br> CENTRALHOSPITAL is the first hospital in India to get an International (Australian Council for Health standards International) and National accreditation (NABH - National Accreditation Board for HCO) way back in 2006 when quality was comparatively a new concept in Indian healthcare Industry. Currently CENTRALHOSPITAL has 8 accreditations which include – ACHSI, NABH, NABL, NABH – Nursing, Medical Imaging Services, Blood bank, Emergency Department & National Neonatal Forum Level-III B for Neonatology. These accreditations ensure safe and benchmarked practices in CENTRALHOSPITAL. We received Patient safety award in the year 2009, Golden Peacock Award for Quality in Health Services in the year 2013 and AHPI award for Quality beyond accreditation. Dr M.I Sahadulla is the only Asian Healthcare Leader to receive the prestigious ACHSI Gold Medallion for his contribution to Quality and Patient Safety.
                
                <br><br>The sustenance of Quality in health care delivery is an essential and important factor which is only possible by implementing effective systems in place. Key Performance Indicator is an effective tool to measure the patient outcome. 72 mandatory indicators help the departments to ascertain that the outcome is measured and benchmarked to international standards. Any spike/trends in KPI are noted by the concerned department and measures are taken to benchmark it to accepted standards. Regular audits are performed on clinical outcomes and these results are published to all staff.
                
                <br><br>Inculcating quality culture is the first step towards building a quality-conscious workforce. To ensure this, all employees who join CENTRALHOSPITAL has to go through a rigorous screening and onboarding program. Clinicians and paramedical staff have to undergo a stringent credentialing and privileging process which ensures that patients are in safe hands. Mandatory on-the-job training is part and parcel of enhancing the skills and competencies of staff.
                
                <br><br>Committees form the backbone of the Quality system.13 clinical and 10 non-clinical committees contribute extensively to enhance the quality of care.
                
                <br><br>Client Management System is actively used for a better patient experience and to meet the expectation of patients. We have five portals for reporting patient complaints and suggestions. Effective and fast grievance redressal system ensures that patient suggestions and complaints are addressed with due importance. No complaint is left unheard by the management. “Patient first” is the motto preached and practiced by the management and staff in CENTRALHOSPITAL.
                
                <br><br>Striving for excellence in healthcare delivery keeps our ranking in the top 5 hospitals in India. Clinical governance and ethical practices help us in developing future generations of safe and ethical healthcare advocates</p>
